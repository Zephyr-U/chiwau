Hi, I am Zephyr, a UM Macao Fellow at the [Institute of Microelectronics (IME)](https://ime.um.edu.mo/), University of Macau. 

I am currently visiting [Chien's Lab](https://chienlab-bioic.github.io/) as a Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley.

I specialize in CMOS analog circuit design, with my research primarily focusing on precision analog circuit design and wearable/implantable monitoring systems. [*Click here*](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2023.3294996) to check my latest research.

What was my recent project?
======
I am currently developing the Ultrasonic Imaging Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) under the supervision of *[Prof. Man-Kay Law](https://ime.um.edu.mo/people/mklaw/)* and [*Prof. Chi-Seng Lam*](https://ime.um.edu.mo/people/cslam/) at the University of Macau.

Also, I am currently developing the galvanically-powered swallowable/injectable implants under the supervision of [*Prof. Jun-Chau Chien*](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/jcchien.html) at UC Berkeley. 

Want to join our research group? 
=======
We are currently seeking students pursuing an MPhil at IME, UM. We are looking for assertive and self-motivated candidates. If you are interested, please send me an email at [*zephyru@um.edu.mo*]()
